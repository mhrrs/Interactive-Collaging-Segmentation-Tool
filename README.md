# Interactive-Collaging-Segmentation-Tool
A C++/QT application that uses ML (spectral clustering, eigen decomp, kmeans) to segment photos based on the number of clusters you desire and then select the clusters for further manipulation.


V1:
This version of the tool just allows you to segment images, they are not customizable yet.

V2:
This version of the tool allows you to segment and manipulate the segmented objects by making them differ in size, orientation, and coloring. This also allows for copies.
